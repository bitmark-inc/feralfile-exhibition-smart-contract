  "name": "Feral File #024 — Peer to Peer",
  "description": "As the first survey organized by an American museum of the leading artists engaged with blockchains, Peer to Peer is an online exhibition and fundraiser that stages an exchange between 13 artists and their historical “peers” in the Buffalo AKG’s collection of modern and contemporary art. It presents works produced with a variety of technologies, from Artificial Intelligence to 3D modeling, and ranging in format from videos and GIFs to PDFs, websites, software applications, and smart contracts. While technologically experimental, the works also speak to—and transform—themes explored by artists over the last two centuries. The exhibition therefore celebrates both the continued relevance of the historical “peers” and the contributions of the new “peers” to art’s expanding network of ideas. — Tina Rivers Ryan ",
