  "description": "A primordium is an organ at the earliest stages of development, a mass of cell tissue teeming with potentiality. For Sage Jenson, primordium is material at the precipice of desire, and their material of choice. Their work functions in the aesthetics of immanence; a place where machinic systems imbue each other with unending possibility, a world in motion, out of equilibrium, and pulsating with unstable flows. Each piece in Primordium, their solo exhibition, embodies this sense of becoming, an ever-unfolding actualization of the shadow future. Each piece has agents (particles) that can sense, navigate, and modify their environment. The environment acts as an arena and message board for the agents. All of the shapes and patterns are emergent behaviors within a rich parameter space. In one sense, the behavior of the agents can be viewed as a reaction to the current state of the environment; in another, the environment is a creation of the agents’ will upon it. — symbios.wiki",
