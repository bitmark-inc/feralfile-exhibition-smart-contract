  "name": "Feral File #015 - Ten Whistlegraphs",
  "description": "Ten Whistlegraphs presents a new body of work featuring creative documentation of a selection of “whistlegraphs” — memorizable lyrical poems that double as graphic scores, resulting in reproducible drawings. A set of files make up each of the ten whistlegraphs curated for Feral File: a high definition video performance and graphic score made for the exhibition, in addition to a curated selection of TikToks of that same work, accessible through a custom interactive player. Each whistlegraph piece we make generates countless media artifacts and recordings in the form of social media posts (by Whistlegraph and fans alike), works on paper, and live recitals. Part of the beauty of this format is that once you grok it, you can make a whistlegraph yourself. Indeed many do write their own whistlegraphs—or interact with the group’s in the form of duets, mashups, and sing-alongs to the tune of digital folk. — Whistlegraph",
